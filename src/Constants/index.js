      "For years, many people have debated whether a hotdog is a sandwich. At first look, it appears to meet the fundamental definition of a sandwich: a filling wrapped between two slices of bread or a roll. However, on closer investigation, the categorization becomes less apparent. One argument against the hotdog as a sandwich arises from its common menu placement. Hotdogs are frequently listed separately from sandwiches in restaurants and fast-food establishments, similar to burgers. This implies that there is a perceived difference between the two. Hotdogs, like burgers, appear to inhabit a distinct realm. Not only that, but a hotdog without a bun is a completely different animal. A hotdog is just a sausage without the surrounding bread. This striking difference emphasizes the significance of the bun in determining a hotdog's character. Unlike sandwiches, which retain their essence regardless of the bread used, the lack of a bun diminishes the hotdog's sandwich-like properties. Hotdogs' adaptability also makes it more difficult to classify them as sandwiches. A common practice is to chop hotdogs and add them to different recipes, including macaroni or spaghetti. When this happens, they completely lose their ability to conjure up images of sandwiches. While the precise definition of a sandwich includes hotdogs, the context in which they are consumed and presented suggests different. Hotdogs are classified as a unique entity from sandwiches due to their distinct menu location. So, despite looks, there is still a compelling argument against hotdogs being categorized as sandwiches. Personally, I have only had hotdogs twice in my life because I don't eat red meat. Instead, I consume a lot of chicken and seafood. So, my opinion on hotdogs is more based on what I observe rather than my personal experience of consuming them frequently.",

      "I saw an animation where a rat lives his whole life chasing happiness, but getting into a futile cycle. At first, the rat sits silently within an elevator, amidst others, saying nothing—just like how we live our lives without inquiry, just conforming to the crowd. This reminds one of Socrates' argument that most human beings live unexamined lives, going along with what is socially accepted without reflection. The rat initially believes that worldly possessions will bring him happiness. He buys a car, excited at first, thinking it will enhance his existence. Soon enough, though, he finds himself stuck in traffic, annoyed and tense. His lovely possession proves to be another reason that aggravates him. Someone eventually even steals some of his car, pointing out how fast worldly possessions can get taken away. Desperate to fill the void, he goes shopping, going to malls and spending money on things he does not need. Like most people in our generation, he is trapped in the consumer trap, thinking that happiness is attainable by purchase. During Black Friday, he rushes into a store, shoving through crowds, hurting himself in the chaos—just to acquire a bargain product that will not bring lasting happiness. Socrates' Apology is a direct allusion to this, as he asserts that most people chase superficial ends—wealth, status, pleasure—without taking into account that these things do not add up to real fulfillment. He warns that an unexamined life, in which one's deeper truths are not challenged, is not worth living. By the end, the rat has all of society taught him to seek—money, materialism, even painkillers to dull the emptiness—but is no happier. This agrees with Socrates' argument that one finds wisdom in the recognition of ignorance and seeking virtue rather than ignorantly seeking the deceptions of pleasure. The rat, like many people, never stops to examine his path, while Socrates encourages us to look back at what is truly important in life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9dZQelULDk",

    `A particularly insightful scene within the TV program Breaking Bad occurs within a flashback with a younger Walter White and Gretchen Schwartz that centers on a debate about the very elements of existence. Walt is standing beside a chalkboard covered with formulas with a look of question about if a key component is missing. Gretchen asks him, “What about the soul?”, to which Walt replies with a shrugging of the shoulders while saying “There’s nothing but chemistry here.”

Walt's assertion—that man is essentially the summation of his chemical interactions— aligned with the belief that the entire existence of man can all be reduced to physical functions. Materialism held by thinkers like Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins is the belief that the existence of the soul is a man-made illusion that is best replaced by the knowledge that man's consciousness is simply a byproduct of brain functions that will eventually stop with the man's death.

This scene from Breaking Bad mirrors my own evolving perspective on the soul and the afterlife. Growing up, I considered concepts like Heaven and Hell as definitive realities that dictated how I should live. However, as I’ve studied philosophy and science, I’ve begun to question whether these beliefs are grounded in truth or simply comforting narratives. If there is no life after death, then the importance of living meaningfully in the present becomes even greater. Like Walt, I’ve wrestled with the implications of a finite existence, but unlike him, I believe morality and purpose still hold value, even without the promise of eternal reward or punishment.

In summary, Breaking Bad forces us to confront a daunting question: is there something about us that exists independent of mere chemical reactions? Or do we, according to Walt's worldview, merely exist as a series of bodily functions to bleed away into the abyss? `,

    `The Inception of Realization – Am I Dreaming?

I’ve always been fascinated by the nature of reality and the way dreams can blur the lines between what is real and what is imagined. Though I haven’t seen Inception, I understand its core idea—the concept of dreams within dreams, the ability to manipulate dream states, and the challenge of distinguishing between waking life and illusion. Recently, I’ve had a series of dreams that have made me question my own reality, pushing me to consider whether I am, at this very moment, inside a dream.

 

This is exactly what Inception describes: the idea that dreams can be indistinguishable from reality, and that with enough awareness, we can recognize when we are inside one. The concept of false awakenings and layered dream states is something I’ve personally experienced. I’ve woken up within dreams, only to realize later that I was still dreaming. I’ve had moments where I actively tried to wake myself up, sometimes by falling backward—a method I’ve used since childhood to escape nightmares. But recently, instead of waking up, I’ve fallen deeper, shifting into another dream state.

 

Descartes questioned whether we could ever truly know if we are awake, and Inception takes that further, asking if our reality is merely another level of the dream. If we accept that reality is constructed by our perceptions, and that those perceptions can be manipulated, then is there ever a way to be truly certain that we are awake?

So, how do I prove that I am awake? How do I test the boundaries of this world? The logic of Inception suggests that reality is constructed through a series of consistent rules. Perhaps, if I look closely enough, I will find an inconsistency—something that betrays the dream.

    `I believe the nature of love differs from person to person, but my take is that love is a promise, but not with another person. Love is something you promise to yourself. I say yourself because it's a very real thing to have someone fall out of love while the other party is oblivious. It's also possible to love people that abuse you and to love people that aren't capable of returning it for whatever reason.

Love is promising to do your best by a person. Some people feel they can still love others even while harming them, and that's why I don't say that love is wanting to see the other person happy. You can love someone while being selfish, so I can't say that love is wanting the best for someone. Now that sounds like when I said love is a promise to do your best, but YOUR best may not necessarily be THE best.

Relationships implode all the time and people are left bewildered because, from their perspective, things were okay or even good. I can even understand feeling that way. If you think things are going well and you personally feel loved, why would you feel like someone joined to you would be in a wildly different place?

I've said before that every tragic love story can be summed up with the sentiment "I thought I was doing it right." That's what love is, unfortunately. Love is doing your best for someone you care about, through the lens of your perspective and framed by your experiences. It's not magic. That means that the love you give wholeheartedly can be something that other people can't use. It can hurt others. It can make them unhappy. Love is imperfect because people are imperfect.

Expectations of it being some perfect panacea for the soul or a matchless balm for the heart only apply when the people are already congruent. If you have to grow and change to love someone a different way than you do, you might not. That's not because you don't love them, but because you don't love them the way that they need and that you can supply.`,

    `Misogyny can come in all shapes and forms—some implicit, some explicit—but all rooted in the same set of patriarchal ideals. For example, there’s the obvious, in-your-face, explicitly women-hating (often violent) rhetoric perpetuated by people like Andrew Tate.

However, misogyny isn’t always loud or aggressive—it can also be subtle, woven into everyday interactions that many men may overlook. A woman’s ideas and suggestions being ignored in a corporate meeting, her competence being questioned more than a male colleague’s, or assumptions that she must be more nurturing and accommodating—these are all manifestations of sexism. While they may not seem extreme they stem from the same societal structures that devalue women.

Take Tate's statement that "women are property." He has persistently suggested that when a man is in a relationship with a woman, she becomes his in a possession sense. This type of discourse robs women of their agency and reduces them to objects of male ownership and control. Similarly, his belief that "a woman's value is based on her youth and beauty" promotes the toxic idea that women are worth something based on their appearance rather than their brain, skills, or personality. These tales don't just stay trapped in Tate's online bubble silos—these seep into the larger culture and quietly affect society's view and treatment of women.

At its essence, all types of misogyny—overt or covert—support the same damaging patriarchal ideologies that aim to control, belittle, or silence women. Andrew Tate's language is merely an extreme expression of the same prejudices that enable society to disregard women's voices in the workplace or devalue their contributions. `,

    `Life is a blessing, and we should all make every day worth it. Unfortunately, there are people who live without caution and do the same thing until they fade away quietly. However, what is it for to be around and then fade away in this way without really living? In order to break this tendency and live a satisfying life, you need to discover a path that brings you meaning, insight, and development. One good way to do this is through this 5-step path to your best life. First of all, discover your passion—what you love to do, what you are capable of doing, and what you are interested in. Real motivation is within you, and you will feel happiness and satisfaction like never before when you find what really motivates you. I discovered my passion through meditation, which made it easier for me to let go of negative thoughts and discover my actual mission. Second, establish a clear vision and goal. Knowing what you really need and visualizing your best possible life gives you the courage to keep going even in times of difficulties. Thirdly, establish consistency—the strong and quiet power that separates successes and failures. With or without talent, doing your best on a regular basis can help you achieve great things. Fourthly, establish routines that energize you. A thoughtful evening routine will make you think and set goals for yourself, while a meaningful morning routine will help you begin your day with a positive tone. Lastly, establish self-discipline. With all these distractions around you, it is necessary to resist short-term gains and look to your long-term happiness. Through meditation, I became more conscious of what I wanted and learned to let it go and make wiser choices. Meditation played a big role in my transformation. It is helping me eliminate bad ideas, know myself for who I am, and live with enthusiasm, a clear mind, and self-discipline.`,

    `Rituals are powerful tools that assist us in organizing, comprehending, and appreciating our mundane lives. It's particularly true when we are bored with routines or are by ourselves in a silent environment. The elegance of rituals lies in how they transform mundane actions into meaningful practices. They enhance our mood and can reveal new aspects of ourselves. An example of a ritual can be preparing a nice cup of tea or coffee in the morning with an attractive cup, saucer, and teapot. It makes the simple act of having a drink more joyful and can brighten our mood. Also, going grocery shopping on a particular day, such as Friday evening after a tiresome day's working, can turn a monotonous task into a source of enjoyment. Choosing your favorite foods or ingredients and afterwards relaxing by watching TV or a program creates excitement and allows us to escape from routine. Having particular self-care routines, such as a Sunday evening ritual with a delicious dinner, bath, and grooming, can become a great beginning to the new week. It enhances our self-esteem as well as overall well-being. The concept isn't about what activities, but about how these rituals build their own little world. It's a short-lived space where we are allowed to feel valued, taken care of, and connected, if only momentarily. You can make life more enjoyable by having friends over to dinner with a theme, such as a monthly dinner of Mexican food. It allows you to also enjoy great food and enhance friendships and sense of belonging as well. Some enjoy embellishing simply, with nice dishes, candles, or tiny treasures on a mirror, as it brings order and beauty into everyday life. Interestingly enough, consideration of rituals brought me to a personal epiphany; I thought I was simply a caffeine addict who needed coffee in the morning so I didn't get headaches. But I discovered it was more than caffeine; it was in the ritual of preparing and enjoying that cup of coffee that helped me feel alert and establish a productive morning ritual.`,

    `In class, we discussed two thought-provoking problems related to ethics. The first was the famous trolley problem. Imagine a trolley in San Francisco, speeding down a track where five people are tied up. You’re standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto another track, where only one person is tied.

 

Initially, my instinct was not to pull the lever—I felt it would be wrong to actively make a decision that results in someone’s death. But as the lecture progressed, and we explored different ethical frameworks like Kantian ethics and utilitarianism, my perspective began to shift.

 

Utilitarianism, argues that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In the context of the trolley problem, a utilitarian would likely pull the lever, reasoning that saving five lives at the cost of one is the more ethical choice because it maximizes overall happiness or well-being.

 

A twist to the problem was introduced: instead of a lever, you are now on a footbridge above the tracks. There is a large man next to you, and if you push him off the bridge, his body will stop the trolley and save the five people. While the outcome is the same—five lives saved at the cost of one—this scenario feels morally different.

 

 According to Immanuel Kant, we must never use people merely as a means to an end. Pushing the man violates this principle, as you’re sacrificing him without his consent. I found this distinction powerful. While utilitarianism focuses on outcomes, Kantian ethics emphasizes the inherent dignity of individuals. Both frameworks challenged my thinking, and I appreciated how they complicated what initially seemed like a simple moral dilemma.`,

    `We studied the fundamental differences between utilitarianism and Kantian ethics this week. These concepts will assist an individual in his ability to grasp different situations. These theories provide essential means of thinking. They guard the individual from ambiguity and enable him to explain and justify his moral ideals clearly.

One of the greatest advantages of learning such theories arises when others attempt to persuade us into doing something unethical. For instance, learning about Kantian ethics helps one determine if someone is doing something purely for their self-interest, not supported by Kant. Kant says people must always be valued for their own worth themselves, not as a means for one to gain from. Therefore, when someone is attempting to have you do something immoral primarily for themselves, learning the Kantian method puts you on solid ground to say no, with a good ethical basis for that.

The best illustration is the one discussed during class for downloading books illegally. It is a demonstration of how one can view a problem from multiple angles, by employing concepts such as utilitarianism as well as Kantianism.

The utilitarian philosophy examines ethics by examining the consequences of an action. Utilitarianism strives for maximizing happiness and minimizing harm. In illegal downloading of textbooks, we examine the long-term consequence: Did illegal downloading make someone a better student with greater knowledge, comprehension, and achievement? Typically, an author only receives a couple of dollars from a one-hundred-dollar textbook. In such a scenario, the educational value of the textbook overshadows the loss of money for the author. Utilitarianism could potentially justify such an action because the benefits of learning and self-achievement are much greater than the loss of money.

Kantian ethics concerns actions by the reasons for doing them and obeying moral principles, rather than the outcome. Kant would want to know why you illegally downloaded the textbook. If you only did it for the purpose of saving money and it infringed someone else's right (such as the writer's right to be paid appropriately), Kant would believe your action is wrong. However, if your actual reason for doing it was for knowledge purposes and you could not afford purchasing the book legally, Kant would believe the action is right, from a universal notion that can be upheld by all, such as promoting knowledge and education.

Acquiring such concepts makes us better able to know right from wrong. It eliminates uncertainty with respect to ethics so that we can make thoughtful and intelligent decisions.`

    `Nietzsche writes of two different kinds of morality, the noble and the slave. He represents these concepts in the image of the eagle and the sheep. When the eagle swoops down from the air and steals a lamb from the flock of sheep to kill it, it presents noble morality. The eagle preys confidently on weaker animals who cannot defend themselves. The eagle never questions whether to or not; it acts based on need and its strength. The sheep, however, embody slave morality. Since the eagle cannot be repelled by the sheep, that slave morality originates in these weaknesses and jealousy. The weaker creatures regard the eagle as unfair, bad, and cruel. This morality arises from weakness, along with jealousy of stronger animals who victimize them.

Nietzsche's concepts in relation to my culture's history fascinate me, particularly the caste system. I personally think the most injustices in my culture were in the caste system. The caste system believed that a person's social status was determined at birth and remained the same throughout his or her life. This meant that if born a king or noble, his or her children were royalty or nobility no matter whether they were virtuous or not. One who was born in the lower caste or as a servant remained in the social status, never getting the chance to rise to the top rank. There aren't yet sufficient reasons I know of why the ruling classes created such a system, but what Nietzsche wrote helps explain it. From the concept of noble morality, we have the understanding of why kings, nobility, or ruling classes created and obeyed strict laws: just because they could. Like the eagle, the ruling class could just act without considering whether it was wrong or right. Probably, their motives were not bad—the ruling class didn't think too much about the pain and losses inflicted upon others but primarily about family, heritage, and privileges.

Just the same as the eagle doesn't consider the hurt of the sheep it devours when it needs food, the higher castes never thought that they were doing something bad while they were in control and powerful. The higher castes must have thought they were getting special privileges, wealth, and protection for their children. The higher castes probably didn't think they were doing something bad; they were just exercising control and power. So, the concepts of Nietzsche demonstrate that systems such as caste could have been created by individuals who were too powerful and weren't necessarily bad.`,

    `Ethical Views 
Should you give money to homeless ?
During my walk through San Francisco's Market Street, a homeless fellow came
to ask me for twenty dollars. That moment raises an ethical question: whether to
donate the money or not. In this paper, I argue why I will not give money.
Kantian ethics, as explained by philosopher Onora O’Neill, is grounded in the
Categorical Imperative—specifically, the principle that we must never treat others
merely as means, but always as ends in themselves . In simple terms, this means
respecting the autonomy and rationality of others, and not using them as tools for
our own goals. If someone gives money to a homeless person just to feel good about
themselves or to appear generous in front of others, they are not acting out of
genuine moral duty—they are using that person to elevate their own self-image.
According to Kant, this is ethically wrong. Kant also emphasizes that the morality of
an action depends not on its outcome, but on the intention behind it. If the intent is
to manipulate someone’s perception—like donating to appear compassionate on a
date—this would be deceitful and unethical under Kantian principles. However, if one
gives the money out of genuine respect for the person’s life and wants to make their
day better, ensuring they have food to eat and clothes to wear, then the act may be

morally praiseworthy. Thus, Kantian ethics does not clearly require giving the money;
it depends entirely on the motive.
Utilitarianism is a moral theory that judges the rightness of an action based
solely on its outcomes. Unlike Kantian ethics, which focuses on intentions and
principles, utilitarianism asks whether an action increases overall happiness or
reduces suffering. Philosopher Peter Singer (1972) argues that if it is in our power to
prevent something bad from happening—without sacrificing anything of comparable
moral importance—then we are morally obligated to do it. In the case of giving $20 to
a homeless person, a utilitarian would ask: what are the likely results of this action? If
the $20 is used to buy food, hygiene supplies, or warm clothing, then the action
results in a net gain of well-being with little to no cost to the giver. In this scenario, the
utilitarian would say that giving the money is morally obligated. However, if the
person uses the money to buy drugs or alcohol and worsens their addiction, then the
outcome might be increasing suffering. Utilitarianism doesn’t care whether you meant
to do good—only whether good actually happened. This means you are still morally
responsible for the consequences of your action, even if your intentions were good.
Singer (1972) takes this responsibility even further. He argues that affluent individuals
in wealthy nations have a duty to prevent suffering wherever possible, even if the
people in need are strangers far away. In his view, failing to help when we can afford to
is not morally neutral—it is wrong. Applying this idea locally, we can see why giving to
a homeless person could be morally praiseworthy, but only if the outcome is positive.
The uncertainty around how the money will be used complicates this. A utilitarian
would advise caution: you should assess the situation carefully—does the person

seem intoxicated? Are they in a state that suggests they might misuse the money?
O’Neill (1986), though writing from a Kantian perspective, agrees that outcomes
matter in some cases—even if Kant’s theory primarily judges actions based on
intentions. If the risk of doing harm outweighs the potential benefit, then from a
utilitarian point of view, giving money is not morally justified. Instead, a better option
might be donating food, toiletries, or contributing to organizations that provide
structured support. That way, you can still promote well-being while minimizing the
chance of unintentionally causing harm.
I think I should not donate the twenty dollars to the homeless man in this
instance because according to Kant, whether or not my action is right depends only
on my intention. If I am giving the money just to make myself feel good or to impress
someone, then I am using the homeless individual as a means to an end instead of
respecting their dignity as a separate person (O'Neill, 1986). That makes the act
immoral even if it has a positive outcome. Utilitarianism also cautions against
prudence. Singer (1972) thinks that we are also responsible for the harm that we
foresee our actions to cause and not the intentions that lie behind them. If the
homeless man spent the money on an addiction or on making himself sick, I would
have done more harm than good. As I cannot foresee with certainty what will occur, I
might be causing harm without intending to do so. My lived experience in turn also
informs my view: having myself commuted in San Francisco and been faced with
disturbing or even threatening behavior on the part of someone who appeared to be
homeless, I usually feel uneasy or doubtful when faced with similar interactions.
Where I am uncomfortable or unsafe, I don't believe I am morally required to engage.

Also, I recognize that part of my motivation to help may be self-serving—I might
give money just to feel like a good person. That would make my intention
questionable from a Kantian point of view. And since I’m not a good judge of whether
someone will use the money constructively, I worry that my action could
unintentionally support harmful behavior. Therefore, while I acknowledge that some
people may be genuinely in need, I don’t think I am morally obligated to give money in
these uncertain conditions.
"No one has ever become poor by giving," Anne Frank recorded in her famous
diary. While this statement embodies the spirit of charity, it also challenges us to
consider more deeply how we give. I argued in this paper why we should not give a
$20 donation to the street homeless person from an ethical standpoint under Kantian
and utilitarian approaches. From Kantian ethics, we learned that we consider the
action good based on whether or not our intent was respectful to others as ends in
themselves. Utilitarianism, as taught by Singer, demonstrated to us that the morality
or immorality of an action depends on its consequences, and that we must consider
whether our actions actually reduce suffering. Giving the money directly is ethically
risky in this situation. It could inadvertently fund addiction or be based on ulterior
motives. Both theories suggest that careful, reflective charity is preferable to
spontaneous, feel-good charity. Finally, moral living involves not just charity, but also
wisdom. As Anne Frank reminds us, giving is powerful, but only if it really makes a
difference.

    `First:

One thing I really liked about this class is how it gave me skills to communicate with anyone. For example, I can now bring up classic thought experiments like the Ship of Theseus—if you replace every part of a ship, is it still the same ship?—or Sisyphus and the stone—where a man keeps pushing a stone up a hill only for it to roll back down. These kinds of philosophical riddles are great conversation starters with all kinds of people. They get others thinking, and they often lead to deeper discussions. I think a year from now, and even five years from now, I’ll still remember these kinds of problems because they stick with you and they challenge how you think. This part of the class was especially memorable because it made philosophy feel real and applicable—not just abstract ideas, but tools for meaningful conversations and self-reflection.

 

Second:

One change I would suggest for the future is to include even more of these types of riddles or thought experiments. They made the lectures much more engaging. I think a great structure would be: start each lecture with a philosophical riddle, have a short class discussion to gather different viewpoints, then the professor could explain the philosophical theories behind it—like Nietzsche’s or Plato’s—and finally ask students if their views have changed. This would do two things: it would make the philosophical ideas stick more clearly, and it would make the whole experience more interactive and memorable.

 

I still remember some of my answers from earlier in the semester and now, after everything I’ve learned, I actually disagree with myself on many of them. For example, we discussed the idea of a machine that gives you constant pleasure. I originally said yes, I would go in. But over the semester, I’ve come to realize that happiness by itself isn’t everything. To truly appreciate happiness, you also have to experience sadness. If you’re feeling pleasure all the time, it loses its meaning. That shift in thinking is something I’ll carry with me for a long time.`,

    answer1: " Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher known for his method of questioning. He engaged in dialogues that challenged people’s beliefs about morality and the good life. He was put on trial in 399 BC for his philosophical activities. Socrates is related to Plato as his teacher; Plato was a student of Socrates and recorded his teachings, including The Apology.",
    answer2: "The two formal charges against Socrates were: i. Corrupting the youth – He was accused of misleading young Athenians through his questioning and philosophical discussions. ii. Impiety (not believing in the gods of Athens and introducing new divinities) – He was accused of denying the traditional gods and believing in new spiritual entities. Socrates responded by arguing that he was not corrupting the youth but rather encouraging them to think critically. He pointed out that if he were corrupting them, someone should have come forward with proof. Regarding impiety, he countered that he could not simultaneously believe in spiritual matters and be accused of not believing in gods, as spiritual entities (demigods) are connected to the divine.",
    answer3: " Socrates believes he is the smartest man alive because the Oracle at Delphi proclaimed that no one was wiser than him. After investigating the claim, he realized that his wisdom lay in knowing that he was not truly wise. The poets, politicians, and craftspeople he examined were unwise because, although they possessed technical or artistic knowledge, they falsely believed themselves to be wise in other matters as well. Socrates recognized that true wisdom is understanding one’s own ignorance.",
    answer4: "Socrates argues that death cannot be bad because it is either: i. A state of nothingness and unconsciousness – which would be like a peaceful, dreamless sleep and therefore not a suffering. ii. A journey to another world – where he could meet and question historical figures like Homer and Achilles, continuing his philosophical inquiries. In either case, he sees no reason to fear death.",
    answer5: "I could argue that happiness and fulfillment do not necessarily require constant questioning.",
    answer6: "If I were in Socrates’ position, I would have likely tried to defend myself in a way that appealed more to the jury, possibly offering a compromise or a less confrontational argument to avoid the death sentence while still upholding my philosophical beliefs.",
    answer7: "This article is significant because it presents fundamental philosophical ideas about wisdom, ethics, and the role of questioning in society.

      "According to Susan Wolf, a meaningful life is one that is actively and at least somewhat successfully engaged in a project or projects of positive value",
    answer2:
     `She highlights figures like Gandhi, Einstein, and Mother Teresa—people deeply engaged in pursuits of value. She also acknowledges artists, scientists, and even athletes whose work contributes something valuable.
• Figures known for their moral virtue or accomplishments, such as Gandhi and Mother Theresa.
• Figures who are not necessarily moral, such as Gauguin, Wittgenstein, and Tchaikovsky.
• Athletes, scholars, and musicians who develop their skills and understanding of the world.
• Ordinary people (neighbors, colleagues, and relatives)Wolf also contrasts these examples with lives she considers meaningless, such as those of:
• "The Blob," a person who spends their life passively watching television.
• The idle rich, who engage in silly, decadent, or useless activities.
• The corporate executive, who works excessively for the sole purpose of accumulating personal wealth.
• The pig farmer, who buys more land to grow more corn to feed more pigs to buy more land`,
    answer3:
      `Because mere existence or passive living (like “The Blob” watching TV all day) lacks meaning. Engaging in valuable projects provides a sense of purpose, but they must be somewhat successful to avoid a sense of failure or futility (as in her “Bankrupt” example of a scientist whose work becomes obsolete before completion). But in the end Wolf does acknowledges that it may not be easy to determine what counts as the right kind or degree of success.`,
    answer4:
      `Wolf argues that meaningful lives aren’t necessarily moral—great artists or athletes might lead meaningful lives without being morally exceptional. However, we should care about living meaningfully because it aligns our lives with a larger reality beyond ourselves, making life feel worthwhile. I’d agree, but morality and meaning often overlap in fulfilling ways.`,
    answer5:
    `Not necessarily. A meaningful life can be fulfilling but also involve struggle, sacrifice, or even suffering. It’s not about pleasure but about deep engagement with things that matter.`,
    answer6:
    `It depends on perspective—some find it unsettling (making life feel insignificant), but Wolf reframes it as an opportunity to align ourselves with meaningful projects, making peace with our smallness. I’d say it’s comforting if we accept that meaning isn’t about cosmic significance but about what we contribute within our limited scope.`,
    answer7:
      ` Because it challenges both nihilism and self-centered definitions of meaning, offering a balanced perspective: we don’t need divine purpose to live meaningfully, but meaning isn’t purely subjective either. It pushes us to think critically about what makes life feel truly worthwhile.`,

  {
    answer1:  `The Soul Lives On idea says that people have an invisible part called a soul that can think and make choices. There are different beliefs about where souls come from:

Creationalism: God makes a new soul for every baby at birth.

Preexistentism: Souls have existed forever, and God gives them to people when needed.

Traducianism: The soul of Adam, the first man, is passed down through generations.

People who believe this think that souls can exist without bodies. In the afterlife, these souls may have experiences like dreams. Richard Swinburne says that the soul is the part of us that thinks and feels, and it is connected to the brain but also created by God.

Problems with This Idea:
Telling Souls Apart: If souls have no physical form, how do we know one soul from another? 

Same Soul Over Time: If a soul changes, for example, through a religious conversion, how do we know it’s still the same soul?`,

 answer2: `I believe that people are made up of both soul and body. I don’t believe in an afterlife. My religion has a concept of rebirth. We keep taking births until we’ve done more good than bad. Once we achieve that, our soul is freed from the pain of constant rebirth.`,

answer3: `Thomas Aquinas’s soul-body composite view sees a human as a combination of soul (form) and body (matter):

The soul is the form of the body, giving it identity.

The body provides the matter, while the soul allows thinking and willing.

After death, the rational soul persists in an intermediate state until reunited with the body at resurrection.

The soul alone is incomplete; it cannot sense or feel, only think and will.

Criticism:

New Category Problem: Aquinas introduces the soul as a "subsisting entity" that is neither a full substance nor a mere property.

Ontological Tension: If the human being is a body-soul composite, yet the soul alone can experience the beatific vision, which has priority?

Individuation Issue: If souls are defined by the bodies they reunite with, but the body’s identity depends on the soul, how do they remain distinct?
`,
 

answer4: `This idea says that a person is the same as their body. For resurrection to happen, the body must be the same as it was before death:

One version says God brings back the original body using the same particles.

Another version says as long as the body keeps changing gradually, it remains the same over time.

Problems with This Idea:
The Cannibalism: If one person’s body is made up of parts from another person’s body, who gets which pieces in the afterlife?

Destroyed Bodies: If someone’s body is completely destroyed, does rebuilding it from the same materials really make it the same body?

Changing Nature of the Body: A body that was once weak and breakable cannot logically become strong and unbreakable while staying the same.`,

answer5: `This idea says that a person is the same if they keep their memories. If someone in the afterlife remembers everything about their earthly life, then they are the same person.

Problems with This Idea:
What If There Are Two? If two people in the afterlife have the exact same memories from one person, are they both the same person? This leads to a logical contradiction.

A Religious Solution: Some believe God would never allow two people to have the same memories, which would prevent this problem from happening.`,

      "The dream argument suggests that there is no definitive way to distinguish between dreaming and waking life. Descartes argues that since dreams can be indistinguishable from reality, we cannot trust our senses. I agree with this argument because it raises questions about the reliability of our perceptions.",
    answer3:
      "A counter-argument to the dream argument is that even if we cannot always distinguish dreams from reality, we can still rely on consistent experiences and logical reasoning to navigate our lives. The existence of an external world can be inferred from the coherence of our experiences.",

    "Eros, based on Plato’s Symposium, is not just a god but a spirit (daimon) mediating between the divine and mortal. Love is born from Poverty (Penia) and Plenty (Poros), making it both needy and resourceful, a seeker of wisdom (philosopher). Love desires the everlasting possession of the good, aiming for immortality through procreation—either physically or through wisdom and virtue.",
    answer2:
      `Aristophanes defines love as the pursuit of our missing "other half." Human beings in their early days were spherical creatures having four limbs, four legs, and two faces—triple the kind. 1. Male-male (Sun) 2. Female-female (Earth) 3. Male-female (Moon) Zeus enacted the segregation of people into pairs as punishment for their excessive conceit. Ever since then, mankind has desired the reunited halves. This explanation defines the nature of romantic attraction and intense emotional connection, sexuality based upon the basic nature of an individual. As per Aristophanes, love is the desire to be complete again.`,

   answer3: `Agathon sees Love as the youngest, fairest, and most virtuous of gods. Love is graceful, wise, just, courageous, and the source of beauty and poetry. He describes Love as:

• Gentle and residing in nurturing atmospheres (feelings, mood, blossoms).

• A festive appreciation, promoting organization and augmenting innovation within artistic and scientific endeavors.

• A force that assures balance and moral purity amongst godly creatures and man.

For Agathon, Love is an ideal being, embodying all virtues and guiding humanity toward beauty and excellence.`,

 


answer4: `Diotima is a wise woman from Mantineia who taught Socrates about love. He calls her his teacher in the art of love, saying she was “wise in many things” and even delayed a plague in Athens. Socrates concedes ignorance and asks for her advice, often expressing dismay at the depth of her understanding. She teaches the concept that Love is not a god but a spirit (daimon), ever tending towards wisdom and beauty. He warmly receives her lessons, believing that they are the genuine nature of love and its intended aim.`,

 


answer5: `Diotima, through Socrates, teaches that love is not a god but a daimon, born from Poverty and Plenty, making it both needy and resourceful. Love is a seeker of wisdom (a philosopher), constantly striving for the good and the beautiful.

Love’s ultimate goal is immortality, achieved through:

• Biological reproduction (progeny)

• Spiritual procreation (wisdom, virtue, and intellectual creation)

Love evolves slowly, starting from physical attraction to the appreciation of the notion of absolute Beauty, eventually leading people to real virtue and enduring fulfillment.`,

 
answer6: `This account forms a crucial analysis because it states the complex view that the ancient Greeks held about love that was not limited to romantic understandings but included intellectual and religious aspects. It defines categories like Philia (friendship), Eros (lust), and Agape (beneficent love), thus providing new understandings about the nature of love that go beyond emotional understanding.`,
  },
  {
    answer1:
    `Misogyny (Example 1): Rush Limbaugh directly called Sandra Fluke a "slut" and a "prostitute" after she fought for the inclusion of birth control in health insurance plans. This behavior is concerning because it is a highly personal and insulting attack, not intended to address her point but to discredit Fluke. Limbaugh misrepresented Fluke's argument by portraying her claim as a demand for taxpayer-funded sex, thus reducing it to an insulting caricature. Additionally, these statements depicted a demonstration of irrational hatred, as he oscillated between seeing himself as financially exploited (the "john") and taking on the role of the manipulator (the "pimp") to Fluke.
 

Sexism (Example 2): Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott asked, “What if men are by physiology or temperament more suited to exercise authority or to issue command?” In addition, he asked, “If it’s true that men have more power generally speaking than women, is that a bad thing?” This statement illustrates a sexist attitude since it aligns with the belief that men have an inherent aptitude for leadership positions, and women are inherently less capable of holding positions of power. These beliefs help rationalize systemic gender disparities in all fields, including politics and business, thus perpetuating patriarchal norms that effectively exclude women from positions of power.

Misogyny (Example 3): The case of the disabled Black woman Rosetta Watson is a prime example of structural misogyny. Despite multiple attempts to approach the authorities for help concerning domestic violence, she was derogatorily labeled as a “nuisance” and ultimately made homeless. This example is all the more concerning because it shows how systemic policy can punish women—particularly marginalized ones—for seeking help. Rather than protecting her against violence, the system made her vulnerable instead, highlighting the fact that misogyny is not just implemented by individual actors but also maintained through societal structures. Moreover, the case is a prime example of misogynoir—an intersection between misogyny and anti-Black racism—oftentimes leading not just to harsher consequences but also towards an entrenched institutional indifference towards Black women.

 `,
    answer2:

    `The comments made by Rush Limbaugh regarding Sandra Fluke are curious, most notably the intense level of outrage he displayed and the bizarre personal fixation he had upon someone he had not met. Fluke was merely advocating the inclusion of contraceptive care within insurance plans; nevertheless, Limbaugh saw her argument as calling for taxpayer support for her sex life. He went on further and called her a “slut” and a “prostitute” and assumed she was trading sexual favors for government support—this is a gross misinterpretation of her actual stance.`,
    answer3: `Manne assumes that instead of analyzing misogyny through the psychological inclinations or goals of the men who practice it, attention must focus upon its concrete consequences for women. This shift involves requiring misogyny to be considered not through the question of whether the abuser feels a complete hatred towards women but through the degree by which behaviors, social expectations, or structural configurations create a harmful environment for women.
Instead of questioning someone's intent behind displaying misogynistic behavior, it is more appropriate to ask the question: Are women undergoing systematic punishment, exclusion, or hostility within certain social contexts? This helps better understand misogyny as a social and structurally embedded phenomenon and not just as something individualist or expressed through open hostility.`,
    answer4: `Manne explains that misogyny is a tool used for the perpetuation of patriarchy. Whereas patriarchy is a system that benefits men over women, misogyny is the means used for policing and punishing women who defy or deviate from the set patriarchal norms.`,
    answer5: `Manne uses the example of Rosetta Watson to illustrate the operation of misogyny in institutional contexts and to show how it intersects with other oppressions, such as racism and ableism.`,
    answer6: `Manne argues that misogyny is better described as a social condition than as a feature of individual personality. While someone's ideas or actions are misogynist when they align with or perform schema that control the behavior of women, it does not follow that such people must have a fundamental hatred towards women as people.`,
    answer7: `Manne differentiates sexism and misogyny according to their functions in patriarchal societies:
Sexism is the ideological aspect embedded in patriarchy. Its role is to validate and justify male dominance by constructing gender roles and ideologies as fundamental or natural.
Misogyny serves as the enforcement arm of patriarchal societies. It punishes the women who are resistant or do not comply with patriarchal ideals.`,

  answer3: `Rituals are thinks we do everyday to do something good.
            Example 1: I close down my laptop at the end of my day, wipe down my desk.
            Example 2: Each morning, I get up to get some coffee. Reason so that I can wake up early.`,


answer4:    `An "as-if world" is one that we opt to perceive the world as being, at least temporarily, through rituals. When we "act as if" we were another person, we create opportunities for change. These rituals help us get better, as we learn good habits and change them over time.`,

answer5:   `They are little acts we perform to be courteous, demonstrating respect and equality—a sign of "as-if" between social classes. Repeating them makes good behavior, and converting those temporary payoffs into habits that last.`,

answer6:    `Confucius questioned the trend to search for a constant "true self." Our identity is something he thought occurred as we experience and practice. Rather than identifying and keeping up with one constant label about ourselves, he advocated applying virtues through conscious activities on an on-going basis. I believe this concept because it promotes active improvement rather than constant focus on fixed qualities.`,

answer7: `This article is really interesting because it’s helped me learn a lot about myself. For instance, I used to think I was a caffeine addict, so I had to wake up early and get coffee or my head would hurt. But I never realized that the ritual of getting coffee itself was actually making me wake up early, which is a good habit!`,

    answer1: `Kant's Most Significant Ethical Principle are called the Categorical Imperative.

O'Neill discusses the Formula of the End-in-Itself.

Treat people like you would like to be treated, as significant people who have their own ambitions. Don't treat them as means for you to obtain what you need.`,

answer2:  `A maxim is the central idea or purpose behind doing something. In Kant’s theory, morality is evaluated by examining if the maxim respects others as ends, rather than mere tools or means.`,

answer3: `Means: Engaging someone in your plans or activities with their clear, informed consent. This is ethically permissible.
Example: When you hire a tutor to teach you mathematics, both individuals participate willingly, and both benefit from the arrangement.

 

Mere Means: Utilizing someone without their genuine consent—typically utilizing deception or coercion—thus not valuing their freedom of choice.
Deception Example: Selling a defective smartphone without disclosing its issues. The buyer is deceived and thus is not able to consent appropriately.

Coercion Example: A manager coerces an employee into accepting poor work conditions by threatening unfair dismissal, thus presenting them with no other choice.`,

 

answer4:  `Deception prevents actual agreement, which is treating individuals merely as means. Tricked individuals do not comprehend your true intention, so they feel like objects rather than precious people. Fake promises are wrong because it deprives individuals of their freedom and capacity for consensual agreements.`,

answer5: `Assisting others in achieving happiness and success.

 Example: Donating to an charity.


It is a moral obligation because it encourages people to help others.`,

 

answer6: `Struggles to explain unplanned or collective action (such as social movements).

Thinks less about overall outcomes.


Broad scope—assesses all actions by consequences. 


Often impractical due to complexity in predicting outcomes. Capable of letting others be in exchange for greater bliss, perhaps objectifying people like objects.`,


answer7: `I think it was a good read cause it took me back to last year when i took the ethical course under your instruction.`,

    answer1: `The singer's general notion is that if we can prevent something bad from being done without sacrificing something worthwhile, then we ought to. For Bangladesh, he reformulates this to read that we ought to prevent something extremely bad from being done without sacrificing something of moral worth.`,
    
    answer2: `The drowning child illustrates how we typically believe in doing good to others when doing so does not involve much to us in return—such as rescuing a child even if we become wet.`,

    answer3: `We ought to alleviate poverty and hunger if we are able to do so with ease, so says the singer. Famine relief is something to be done, not something generous, and believes we ought to donate until doing so no longer means much to us.`,

    answer4: `Being distant does not alter what we must do. In an interconnected world, we can assist far-off people just as much, and we have to view all pain in the same way.`,

    answer5: `Having other individuals to assist does not take away from our responsibility. Even if others are present, we would attempt to save a child drowning. We have to act even if others are doing nothing.`,

    answer6: `I do not anticipate a radical transformation, but I am certain to implement certain aspects of it.`,
    answer7: `This article is intriguing because it presents a diverse perspective on ethical dilemmas and explains certain reasons why individuals engage in actions that are clearly morally reprehensible.`,

    answer1: `Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a German philosopher who disrupted conventional thinking about right and wrong and religion. He wrote influential books like Thus Spoke Zarathustra and On the Genealogy of Morals. He encouraged people to think for themselves, wasn't Christian nor was he a nationalist, and believed that life should be guided by art and philosophy. In spite of personal problems and mental collapses, his work continues to have a profound impact—though later misrepresented by his sister and exploited by the Nazis and others.`,

    answer2: `A genealogy is Nietzsche’s way of tracing how modern values developed historically, especially through religion and social changes. In his Genealogy of Morals, he shows how morality evolved from power dynamics, psychological shifts, and historical events—not eternal truths. He focuses on how Christian values came from weakness and resentment, not strength.`,

    answer3: `Nietzsche claims that "bad conscience" emerged when humans, previously wild and instinctual, were able to reside in society. Because they couldn't act upon their natural impulses, they turned inward, and this created a sense of guilt, self-berating, and a psychological "sickness." This internalized strife, although producing the soul, was a debilitating alienation from animalistic past.`,

    answer4: `Noble morality derives from strength and self-confidence in oneself—it affirms life and values on the basis of individual qualities. Similar to Egals
It originates with weakness and anger. It measures the good by weighing itself against the powerful. It says "no" to others rather than "yes" to itself like a flock of sheep.`,

    answer5: `Nietzsche says slave morality starts when oppressed people, like early Christians, are denied power or revenge. Instead of acting, they turn inward and create values that reject their oppressors. They call the powerful “evil” and themselves “good.” This morality isn’t about self-worth, but about flipping the values of those who hurt them—making weakness a virtue and strength a sin. It’s a reactive way of creating meaning from oppression.`,

    answer6: `Nietzsche states that contemporary morality originates in instincts blocked and redirected inward (bad conscience) and in the resentment of weak individuals (ressentiment). This generated Christian values promoting guilt and neglecting natural desires, which originated through feeling weak, not from goodness.`,

    answer7: `I really like this article because it shows how one philosophy can be interpreted in totally different ways by different people. It makes you think about how ideas get twisted depending on who’s reading them or what their agenda is. One major thing it highlights is how Nietzsche’s work was misunderstood and misused, even though he was actually against the things people claimed he supported. It reminds you to question what you hear and look deeper into where ideas really come from.`,

   answer1: `Plato describes people born chained in a cave, only able to see shadows on a wall cast by a fire behind them.`,

  answer2: `They believe the shadows are real because they’ve never seen the actual objects.`,

  answer3: `A freed prisoner sees the real objects and, eventually, the outside world and sun—realizing the shadows were illusions and discovering a higher truth.`,

  answer4: `The other prisoners resist and even wanted to kill the returnee for challenging their beliefs.`,

  answer5: `Yes—Plato suggests we should seek the truth beyond appearances.`,

  answer6: `Plato argues that sensory experience shows only imperfect copies of true reality. Real knowledge comes from philosophical reasoning and understanding the forms.`,

  answer7: `I think this article is cool because it shows that even when we see or think something is true, we should still question it.`,
